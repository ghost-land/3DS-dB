They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are responsible for your daily troubles! As you explore the world, use your Yo-kai Watch to find them, befriend them, and turn them into a team to battle other Yo-kai. Every Yo-kai has a unique personality and abilities, so it will take strategy to form the right team and gain the upper hand against troublesome Yo-kai. Learn more at nintendo.com.au/yo-kai-watch",
