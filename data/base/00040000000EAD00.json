    "description": "After months of bitter conflict with its neighbor, country A is preparing to unleash its latest machine of war, code-named Kokuga. With access to 9 destructive weapons and an array of power-ups, the compact mobile tank is an elite military machine.\n<br><br>\nHighly-reputed boutique game studio G.rev is pleased to offer this old-school strategic shooter for the Nintendo 3DS.\n<br><br>\nPlayers are tasked with piloting Kokuga, and must destroy tanks, drones, gun towers and other mecha in 12 different training missions. Each stage culminates with a boss fight, pitting the player against massive heavily-armed bosses. Upon receiving orders for active duty, the player is thrust into action against enemy forces.\n<br><br>\nStructured so gamers have maximum freedom in their game experience, Kokuga is great for both casual game sessions or long challenges.\n<br><br>\nLocal and Download Play is supported, so assemble your squad of up to four players! Develop new strategies and help out your teammates by coordinating card use.",
