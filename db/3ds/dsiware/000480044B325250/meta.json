Primrose rules are easy:\nThere are no time limits, no levels or\narbitrary objectives and no\nconstraints.<br>\n<br>\nYou must place pairs of tiles on a\ngame grid and attempt to corral\ngroups of tiles with pieces of a\ndifferent colour. When that happens,\nsurrounded tiles disappear and\nsurrounding tiles change colours,\nallowing chain effects to trigger\ncombos for massive points. You can\nplay for long matches, surviving\nagainst the increasing difficulty, or\njust go all out on a huge single move\ncombo of millions of points.<br>\n<br>\nRelax, enjoy and welcome to\nPrimrose.",
