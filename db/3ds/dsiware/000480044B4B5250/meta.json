    "description": "Before the Big Bang shaped the\nuniverse as we know it, a place\nexisted with fewer dimensions than we\nhave today. It is there that our hero's\njourney began. Carrying with him a\nspecial device that allowed him to flip\nbetween these flat dimensions...<br>\n<br>\nFlip the Core is an artistic and unique\ntake on the classic Shoot 'em up\ngenre and combines fast shooting\naction with strategic thinking. In this\nside-scrolling action game, you can\nliterally flip your screen at will,\nchanging walls into tunnels, a death\ntrap into a passage way, move an\nenemy from one spot to the\nnext... Unless you truly believe in\ndead ends... there are none.",
