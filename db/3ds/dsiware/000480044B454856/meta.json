    "description": "Dive into a unique audio-visual\nexperience where technology meets\nart. Created by multimedia musician\nToshio Iwai, Electroplankton are living\naquatic 'instruments' that you interact\nwith to produce a variety of sounds\nand images limited only by your\nimagination!<br>\n<br>\nResembling snowflakes,\nMarine-Crystal plankton float on water\nin clusters of 35. When touched, they\nspin and produce vibrant sounds, and\ngrow in size if they are tapped\nrepeatedly. They are born in one of\nfour geometric shapes: triangle,\nsquare, pentagon and hexagon; and\ntheir tone changes depending on their\nshape.<br>\n<br>\nUse Performance mode to create\nyour own unique compositions, or\nrelax with Audience mode and let the\nElectroplankton run wild.<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that elements of this\nsoftware may have been featured in\npreviously-released software.",
