    "description": "The ever-popular Puzzle League comes to Nintendo DSiWare! Like all good puzzlers, the concept is simple: connect blocks of the same color to clear them from the screen, and prevent your stack from becoming too high. There are four single player modes to choose from: Endless (survive to earn a top score), Clear (eliminate all blocks above the line), Score Attack (score as high as possible in two minutes), and Vs. COM (use items and combos to attack a computer opponent). You can choose from a variety of background music to get you ‘in the zone’, and even play in horizontal or vertical mode, holding the Nintendo DSi system normally or like a book. Whichever way you play, you’re guaranteed maximum fun!",
