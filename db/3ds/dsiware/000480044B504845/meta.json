So when greedy dinosaurs guzzle his village's winter food source, Sam is mad! Armed with his best club and his powerful hunter's voice, Sam needs your help to guide him through 22 levels of food-gathering and dinosaur-bashing. With fast-paced action, hundreds of secret areas, weapons and unlikely vehicles to find, you'll need to be smart. Well, smarter than Sam, anyway...",
