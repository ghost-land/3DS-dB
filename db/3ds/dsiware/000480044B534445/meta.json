    "description": "Use your familiars to shoot down the enemy!\n\nDestroy the enemy by making use of the four familiars that fly in formation around the player vessel in this side-scrolling shooting game. Quickly switch the formation pattern of your familiars with the touch of a button. When you destroy an enemy, its soul becomes available to collect. Collect the soul with one of your familiars to upgrade its attack or switch it to a different attack type. The familiar's attack can be upgraded by collecting multiple souls of the same color in a row. The four familiars power up and change independently of each other, making for a game of strategy as you plan how to use each one effectively.",
