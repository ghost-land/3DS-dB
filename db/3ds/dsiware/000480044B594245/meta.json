Not only will you put your face into the game with the Nintendo DSi Camera, Face Pilot: Fly With Your Nintendo DSi Camera! also tracks your head's movements to give you complete control of your glider. Simply tilt your head sideways to steer left and right, lean back to climb, and bend forward to dive.\n\nChoose from two play styles and fly through three different types of game play: burst all of the balloons in a variety of courses to reach their goal, throw balls at targets for a high score, and try for a fast time in the high speed challenge. Also, look out for hidden medals which help unlock new courses and even new gliders!\n\nIf you’re looking for a truly unique and inventive game, schedule a flight to experience Face Pilot: Fly With Your Nintendo DSi Camera! yourself. The only thing missing is the wind in your hair!\n\n",
