    "description": "Color Commando is a new and very\ncool puzzle platform game.\n<br/><br/>\nIn this game you get to hunt for\ntreasure! However, many evil color\nmonsters are blocking your path! Pick\nup color blobs and try to outsmart the\nmonsters!\n<br/><br/>\nIn each level, color monsters will\nblock your path and try to grab you!\nSo what can you do against this?\n<br/><br/>\nCollect paint blobs that are spread\nout over the level. You can use a paint\nblob to paint a big paint-spot on the\nworld. If a monster of the same colour\ncomes into contact with the\npaint-spot, the monster will dissolve\ninto the spot. When this happens the\nmonster cannot harm the player!\n<br/><br/>\nThe game starts out easy enough, but\nbefore you know it you are\nsurrounded by many different types of\ncolor monsters in all different colours!\n<br/><br/>\nThere are five worlds, each with four\nnormal levels and one star level. You\ncan unlock the star level by getting\nall the treasure in the other four\nlevels!\n",
