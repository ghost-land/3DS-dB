    "description": "The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between\n<br>Worlds follows on from the story of\n<br>the 1991 Super NES instalment,\n<br>telling a new story in the kingdom of\n<br>Hyrule. The 3D visuals of\n<br>Nintendo 3DS bring a new layer of\n<br>depth to the game world, allowing\n<br>you to experience heights like never\n<br>before. It might once have been\n<br>difficult to tell the difference between\n<br>floor levels, but they are now quite\n<br>clear, lending more realism to the\n<br>battles and dungeon exploration!",
