    "description": "Gear up and join an elite Special Forces unit in Heavy Fire: Special Operations 3D, an arcade-style on-rail shooter for Nintendo 3DS™. Choose from three character profiles, each with unique attributes, and use a combination of brains and brawn (but mostly brawn) to blast your way through a variety of dangerous ground, vehicle and air-based stages. And if you’re really feeling trigger-happy, you can earn additional points by blowing up the environment. Each victory sees your military rank rise, earning you increasingly powerful and upgradeable weapons. \nYou’ll need preternatural reflexes and a never-say-die spirit to restore peace in the ever-volatile Middle East. When the smoke clears, will you be a Special Operations legend? \n<br><br>\nFeatures: <br>\n- A destructible environment featuring exotic Middle Eastern locales <br>\n- Slug your way through six diverse, challenging levels <br>\n- Higher military ranks enable more powerful weaponry <br>\n- A game store bursting with all kinds of cool power-ups",
