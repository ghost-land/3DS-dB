    "description": "Years ago, a tunnel connected livestock-loving Bluebell village with the crop-growing town of Konohana, but boisterous bickering between the burgs created a cave-in and collapsed the tunnel! Build a bustling farm, befriend the villagers, and maybe you can find a way to bring these towns together once again!\n<br><br>\nChoose from two different villages, each with their own shops, villagers, and festivals!<br><br>\n\nTake on quests in each town and establish your reputation as the best farmer on both sides of the mountain!<br><br>\n\nGrow crops, raise livestock, woo a spouse, and start a family!",
