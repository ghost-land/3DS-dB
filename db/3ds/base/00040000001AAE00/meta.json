Even if a\n<br>desperate situation arrives, Kutar will\n<br>just inflate his body and overcome.\n<br>What a wonderful Yuru-chara.\n<br>\n<br>The lovely and funny Kutar game\n<br>series is everywhere! Just finish the\n<br>quest's challenges with simple\n<br>controls.\n<br>\n<br>This time Kutar performs as the\n<br>stuntman and challenges his limits, to\n<br>raise your rating, you must ride\n<br>through the explosives found on the\n<br>road.",
