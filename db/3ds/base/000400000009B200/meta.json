    "description": "Blok Bombing is a fine and ancient sport invented by a small and creative troop of primates, called Bomb Monkeys. The goal is simple: do not allow the bloks rising from the jungle floor to reach dangerous heights and knock you from your perch.\n<br><br>\nWith an endless supply of bloks and a steady stream of bombs, you can partake in this legendary sport anytime you have a spare moment. Young Bomb Monkeys will learn patience and strategy. Older Bomb Monkeys will sharpen their wits. And, every Bomb Monkey will have a blast!\n<br><br>\nSeveral variations on the classic “Endless” Blok Bombing sport have emerged over the centuries, providing both variety and unique challenges for avid enthusiasts of the sport.",
