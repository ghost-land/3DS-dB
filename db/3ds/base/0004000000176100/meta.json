You’ll need to use your wits to\n<br>investigate the surroundings, puzzle\n<br>out clues, and outsmart the monsters\n<br>before it’s too late! Survive a trek\n<br>through your neighborhood, unravel\n<br>the mysteries of the Dead House, and\n<br>sneak through the mall after hours;\n<br>only then can you confront Slappy\n<br>and stop his plans for revenge!\n<br>",
