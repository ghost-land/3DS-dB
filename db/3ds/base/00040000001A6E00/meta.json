    "description": "The 2D high speed, old-school style side-scrolling action that you remember from Azure Striker Gunvolt is back! In this game, Gunvolt's rival Copen from the first installment returns to the fray as a playable character!\n<br>\n<br>Gameplay Features:\n<br>\n<br>1. Prevasion\n<br> This ability allows Gunvolt to neutralize enemy attacks at the cost of his EP energy. Copen also has an ability exactly like this.\n<br>\n<br>2. Kudos\n<br> Kudos is a point system that increases whenever you deal damage to an enemy. Whenever you take damage, your Kudos are reduced to zero. When activating a save point, using a special skill or clearing a mission, Kudos are converted into bonus points.\n<br>\n<br>3. The Muse's song\n<br> For as long as you can maintain 1000 or more Kudos, the BGM will change and Lumen AKA The Muse (or in Copen's story, Lola) will sing for you!\n<br>\n<br>4. Anthem\n<br> When Gunvolt or Copen's HP reaches 0, the Muse's power can bring them back to life, with additional power-ups. In that state, the BGM will change to the Muse's song.",
