OK... say\n30, to the old days, when everything\nlooked really simple and the rest was\nleft to your imagination.\n<br/><br/>\nThe main aim in the 10 in 1: Arcade\ncollection is to survive the classic\nchallenge and achieve the highest\nscore possible.\n<br/><br/>\nRetro arts, particle effects and\nwonderful 8-bit music will also bring\nback fond memories of youth for\nsome, and for those too young to\nremember, it will be a great showcase\nof the old times!",
