By tilting the Nintendo\n3DS system you’ll alter the angle of\nthe entire stage, causing PAC-MAN to\nroll at high speed and setting him up\nto use level elements like flippers and\nswings that can catapult him to new\nheights. It’s a whole new way to take\ncontrol of one of gaming’s most\nfamous heroes, and it’s all brought to\nlife in glorious 3D!",
