In the midst of this confusion, Eil enters into a pact with the Air Grimoa, Nogard, in order to save everyone. \n<br>Eil and Nogard set off to look for the demon who cast the town into a sea of flames, and to find other Grimoas in order to put a stop to its violence!\n<br>\n<br>The game features classic turn-based battles, with a Synchro Gauge system which lets you unleash powerful skills when synchronized with the Grimoas.
