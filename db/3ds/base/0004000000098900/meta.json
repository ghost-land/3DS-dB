Uncovering Mimiga Village you\ndiscover that the once-carefree\nMimiga are in danger at the hands of\na maniacal scientist.\n<br/><br/>\nTheir only hope rest squarely on the\nshoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy\nwho can't remember his own name.\nTake control and learn the origins of\nthis worldâ€™s power, stop the\ndelusional villain and save the Mimiga!",
