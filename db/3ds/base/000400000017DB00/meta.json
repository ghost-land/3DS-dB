As you solve the\n<br>different levels, you receive objects\n<br>that will help you unlock memories\n<br>from his life. The more memories you\n<br>get, the closer you are to regaining\n<br>his sanity.\n<br><br/><br/>\n<br>Go crazy and help the Baron get his\n<br>sanity back! But be careful...the\n<br>rooms of the mansion move about and\n<br>it's easy to get lost in his world.",
