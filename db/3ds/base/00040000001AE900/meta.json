    "description": "This game is set on the Yui Rail, a\n<br>railway located at the southern most\n<br>point of Japan amidst the tropical\n<br>atmosphere of Okinawa prefecture.\n<br>The monorail travels along a grand\n<br>total of 12.9 kilometers of railway.\n<br>\n<br>The Yui Rail runs entirely on an\n<br>elevated railway! From a height of 20\n<br>metres from the ground, you can look\n<br>out the window and feel like you are\n<br>taking a walk above the city.\n<br>\n<br>Night Mode is also included.\n<br>Changing from Day Mode, enjoy the\n<br>peaceful glittering lights of the city at\n<br>night.\n<br>\n<br>Simple to operate! With just one\n<br>lever you can easily control power\n<br>and breaking. Aim for a high rating by\n<br>paying extra attention to the speed\n<br>limit as you take on the steep slopes\n<br>and sudden curves with the monorail!\n<br>\n<br>Enjoy your time as a monorail\n<br>conductor as you take in the\n<br>refreshing view while speeding across\n<br>the elevated railway.",
