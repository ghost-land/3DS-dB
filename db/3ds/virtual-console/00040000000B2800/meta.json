    "description": "Revenge of the Gator is a snappy\npinball simulation that packs a table\nfull of tricks and traps into a perfect\npocket size.\n<br/><br/>\nThere are four scrolling screens and\nthree bonus stages to get your teeth\ninto. Direct the ball into certain spots\nto trigger extra balls and score\nmultipliers. But donâ€™t let the ball fall,\nor the hungry gator below will\nswallow it up.\n<br/><br/>\nYou can also grab a friend and\nengage in the two player mode by\ntaking turns to see who can score the\nhighest.",
