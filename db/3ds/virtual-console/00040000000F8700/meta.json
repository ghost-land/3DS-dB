Mighty Final Fight takes the\nconcept of the original arcade version\nbut shrinks the characters to mini\nproportions, yet beefs up the\ngameplay with the addition of an\nexperience system to level-up\ncharacters’ abilities.\n<br/><br/>\nUnlike other versions you can play as\neach of the three main characters.\nBrawl your way through five\nhard-hitting levels, plus bonus rounds,\nbefore the face-off with the final boss.",
