Hitting the grids will either weaken or destroy them, and you'll need to keep returning shots until the entire field is cleared! \n<br><br>\nAs you progress through each level, you will confront new challenges of alternating stages, bonus rounds, and more. Speed and agile reflexes will quickly become your strongest allies as you reach to beat the top score!\n<br><br>\nYou're in command in the Alleyway!",
