The life-form has grown beyond their control and intends to wage war on all humans. Using the strong weapons and high jump power of SOPHIA, Jason must head to the subterranean region where the life-form resides and eliminate everything in his path. In narrow places, Jason must exit SOPHIA and move through catacombs on foot. In the catacombs, you control Jason in the top-down view, and battle with guns and grenades.",
