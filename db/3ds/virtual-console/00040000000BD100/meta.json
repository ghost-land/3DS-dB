    "description": "Mario Bros. is a treasure trove of\ngaming history. The follow-up to the\nhit Donkey Kong™, it was not only the\nfirst time our hero was known as\nMario, it also introduced his brother\nLuigi, green pipes, coins and even\nmore now-familiar elements of the\nMario series.\n\nThe gameplay is simple yet\nchallenging: eliminate all the enemies\nin each level for a big score.\nHowever, Mario cannot jump on\nenemies from above so must hit them\nfrom below and finish them off with a\nkick. Add a second player as Luigi for\neven more fun!",
