    "description": "After breaking into a paint store in New York City, the cops are now coming after you! Carrying leaky 10-gallon paint cans, drive over every mile of New York City highways before catching a boat to England. From there, you will go on a tour of the world, avoiding the police and leaking paint all over the place. Your only defense: picking up oil cans left on highways and throwing them at police cars. \n<br><br>\nSend the police for a spin, and knock them off the road as you make your getaway!",
