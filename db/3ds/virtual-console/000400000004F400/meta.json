    "description": "A long time ago, the Ghoul Realm barely escaped great peril. A large army of powerful beings called Destroyers came from a neighboring universe, overpowering the creatures of the Ghoul Realm. Just when everyone had given up hope, a great fire swept over the Realm, wiping out the Destroyers' army.\n<br><br>\nSeveral hundred years have passed, and the Realm is threatened once again. As the gargoyle Firebrand, you are destined to become the Red Blaze, the same powerful force that fought back the Destroyers so long ago. Now, you must traverse the Ghoul Realm and build your powers and abilities as you prepare to take on the Destroyersâ€™ King Breager and ensure the protection of the Ghoul Realm.",
