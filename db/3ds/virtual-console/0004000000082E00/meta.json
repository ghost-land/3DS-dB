It’s your job to exterminate all the monsters plaguing the planet, but you’ll need some real muscle to accomplish that task. Good thing you have a secret weapon: a turbo-charged vacuum cleaner!\n<br><br>\nArmed with your trusty vacuum, work your way through eight monster-infested worlds. Special items, power-ups, and a password system will help you on your way, but at the end of the day, it’s all up to you! Hungry for even more action? Have no fear.
