Living life in a lighthouse rather than a bottle, she's constantly on the lookout for danger. When the nefarious lady-pirate, Risky Boots catches wind of the treasure that was recently unearthed in the village, she launches an attack.\n<br><br>\nTo get Scuttle out of trouble, it's up to Shantae to prove that she's the rightful “Guardian Genie” to the best of her dancing, buying and hair-whipping abilities.  Learn “Dance Magic” to get new attacks, and battle your way through over 50 locations and Mini-Games!",
