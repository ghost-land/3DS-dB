    "description": "Original Release Date: December 1998.\n<br><br>\nYou have inherited your grandfather’s farm and been given the opportunity to succeed as Ranch Master. Those are some pretty big shoes to fill in as the life of a farmer isn’t exactly a walk through the park. To build a successful farm, you will need a lot of working capital. Learn to juggle elements of farming and ranching as you face new challenges at the turn of the seasons. You can also enlist the aid of nearby townsfolk to trade and gather supplies. If you can overcome the cold temperatures of winter, the title of Ranch Master may yet be yours!",
