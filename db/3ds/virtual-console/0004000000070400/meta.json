In Balloon\nFight you have one simple mission:\npop or be popped!\n<br/><br/>\nBurst enemies' balloons from above,\nand hit them again before they have\ntime to re-inflate. Danger comes from\nthe sky or sea, too; watch out for\nlightning strikes and a very hungry\nfish.\n<br/><br/>\nBalloon Fight also features a\ntwo-player mode with cooperative and\ncompetitive play, plus a survival mode\ncalled Balloon Trip - which may be\nfamiliar to fans of Nintendo Land™!",
