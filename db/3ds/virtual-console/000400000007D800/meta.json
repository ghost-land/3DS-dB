It's that rotten Captain Syrup and the Black Sugar Gang! I'm looking out for bad guys and scavenging for coins as I track down my treasures. If I don't get them all the first time, that's OK. I can go back again and again until I find them all. Captain Syrup doesn't stand a chance against me!<br><br>\nWith lots of hidden treasures, bonus games, and multiple endings, we're in for our own voyage of discovery!",
